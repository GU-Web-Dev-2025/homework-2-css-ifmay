               <h2>Summary</h2>
               <p>
                  Hi, I’m Isabelle May, an honors computer science student at Gonzaga University with a concentration in Data Science and minors in mathematics and Hogan entrepreneurial leadership.
                  I’m a curious and driven problem-solver with hands-on experience in software development, data analytics, and
                  project management. I’m especially passionate about building data-driven tools and applications that improve 
                  business insights and decision-making. Outside the classroom, you’ll often find me skiing, hiking, camping, 
                  or enjoying practically anything outdoors. I’d love to connect!
               </p>
